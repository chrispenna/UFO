## UFO Sightings Data Analysis in the United States

Over the course of human history, UFOs have consistently stirred curiosity, presenting an enduring enigma. Recent events, earlier this year, elevated this fascination, with UFOs increasingly becoming a prominent feature in the news and capturing the public's imagination. High-profile sightings and discussions around unidentified aerial phenomena have fueled a surge in public interest, shaping discussions on the potential existence of extraterrestrial life.

Prompted by these extraordinary assertions and fueled by my curiosity, my goal is to systematically explore the mysteries surrounding UFO phenomena. This exploration analyzes recorded UFO sightings in the United States over the past 100 years, aiming to provide valuable insights beyond sensationalism. Key questions drive my investigation: Which regions have higher UFO sightings? Are there trends in sightings over different eras? What are the most common UFO descriptions? The goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon, moving beyond the current buzz and delving into systematic and insightful analysis.
